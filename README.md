# Mangas Checklist

Simple app to view the monthly checklists from the brazilian manga publishers.

Unfortunately, the publishers doesn't provide an proper API, 
so the app just crawl the data from their websites, by simple
requests, and show the content.

The possibility of a creation of an proper server dedicated to 
parse the data exists, but it's not the main purpose.

## Future features

- Notifications when the checked mangas are available.

## Publishers
